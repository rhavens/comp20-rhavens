<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this repository is to showcase all of the coursework I completed throughout the semester in COMP 20. Additionally, working in this repository helped me ascertain an understanding of git and source control in general.</p>

<h3>
<a id="favorite-assignment" class="anchor" href="#favorite-assignment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Favorite Assignment</h3>

<p>My favorite assignment would have to be the <em>Marauder's Map</em> assignment. Working with the Google Maps API to visualize the JSON locations was extremely interesting and demonstrated how powerful APIs and public libraries are in building intricate webpages.</p>

<h3>
<a id="growth" class="anchor" href="#growth" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Growth</h3>

<p>On day 1, all I had was a rudimentary understanding of HTML/CSS from a course I had taken years back, back when the internet was simple and the web development stack small. This course opened my eyes to the vast possibilities in the world of web programming, front-end AND back-end. I learned various new programming languages and encouraged myself to push new boundaries in researching extra topics such as templating and serving dynamic content.</p>

<h3>
<a id="important-takeaways" class="anchor" href="#important-takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important Takeaways</h3>

<p>The two most important things I learned were (a) Never trust data from a client (input validation) and (b) How to work on and manage a development team. For the former, I learned valuable lessons about web security from the <em>Security</em> assignment where we attempted to maliciously attack a project developed by a fellow classmate. It also put in perspective how many concepts a professional developer would need to juggle in order to ensure a safe, secure website. For the latter, as part of our semester group project we learned how to assign tasks and work on different pieces while still designing a singular core concept. It was a great exercise in teamwork and self-motivated research.</p>

<h3>
<a id="next-steps" class="anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I am still quite interested in all aspects of web programming, particularly the ways I can use server-side code to create dynamic, user-specific content. Jason Brillon and I are designing a new website for our fraternity using the skills we learned in COMP 20, and I am also looking to work with APIs of popular games alongside JavaScript data visualization libraries to explore data patterns.</p>
