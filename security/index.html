					<h1>Security Overview for "Where in the World"</h1>
					<h1><small>Prepared by Ryan Havens</small></h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog-post">
					<h2 class="blog-post-title" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
					<p>This is a security overview for Sophie Dasinger's implementation of the client-side/server-side arrangement of "Where in the World." The implementation of the assignment required setting up a server which would process requests including a user (a "login") and their location coordinates (a "lat" and a "lng"). This data is parsed and entered into a Mongo database where it can then be accessed.</p>
					<p>The accesses come in two forms: a primary, general form displayed on the homepage wherein all inquiries are displayed, and a second, specific form, for which given a specific login returns all entries for that login in JavaScript Object Notation format.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="blog-post">
					<h2 class="blog-post-title" id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
					<p>The first form of security probing I used was a set of simple curl requests, for example <pre>curl localhost:3000/sendLocation --data "login=X&lat=Y&lng=Z"</pre></p>
					<p>Simple client-side data can be used to manipulate the server into failing to operate as intended or crashing. A number of different methods can be used with curl, such as sending bad HTML, scripts, or bad data.</p>
					<p>I also ran <a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/download.html">Burp Suite</a> tests on the webpage to discover further vulnerabilities.</p>

					<h2 class="blog-post-title" id="abstract">Abstract of Findings</h2>
					<p>In brief, never trust data from the client. Because of a lack of input parsing and input restrictions, it is easy to cause damage to the webpage or the server itself. The latitude and longitude inputs are parsed, but literally anything can be sent into the login form.</p>

					<h2 class="blog-post-title" id="issues">Issues Found</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>1. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</h4></li>
						<li><p>According to <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">Wikipedia</a>, Cross-site scripting is a type of computer security vulnerability which enables attackers to inject client-side script into web pages which may then be viewed by other users.</p></li>
						<li><p>Special characters are not parsed from input, which makes submitting a malicious script as part of the login form as simple as placing &lt;script&gt; tags. Also important is that there are no contorls in place limiting script src location - I was able to insert jQuery into the page by using a CDN.</p></li>
						<li><h4>2. No restrictions on input</h4></li>
						<li><p>Using Burp Suite, I posted a number of test forms, some containing sanitary data and some containing bytecode from zipped file packages (essentially garbage input). I discovered that there was no restriction on the size of input - I could inject as large a string as I wanted for the login form, and it would still render on the page.</p></li>
						<li><p>This also, interestingly enough, led me to discover that errant styling could be injected into the page by inserting HTML tags that lacked matching close tags.</p></li>
						<li><img src="pic1.png" height=325 width=550 ></img></li>
						<li><img src="pic2.png" height=325 width=550 ></img></li>
						<li><h4>3. Unverifiable Location Input</h4></li>
						<li><p>The location input on this site is 100% reliant on the client input and unverifiable from server side. A user could theoretically state they were at the South Pole, when, in reality, they were at the North Pole. It is difficult to resolve this issue but I can propose two possible solutions.</p></li>
						<li><p>The first is to get the user's geolocation using a GeoIP lookup. This would ensure the reliability of data input for 95% of users. However, users using a proxy or VPN service would be able to mask their actual IP.</p></li>
						<li><p>The second solution is to encrypt the geolocation using a hash key. Prevent generic form input and only permit form input through a specific form, which generates an encryption as it generates the location data and sends both the key and the data to the server. (alternatively, have it use the same key each time, with knowledge of the key stored on the server). The geolocation method would also include a function pinging nearby smartphones and transmitting their MAC addresses to the server in order to cross-check the information. In this way it would be impossible to fudge data and get around processing the geolocation request. This method would prevent all but the most clever of users from falsifying their input.
						<li><h4>4. Malicious Database Queries</h4></li>
						<li><p>A user accessing the page could theoretically send malicious spam in bulk to sendLocation which would cause the database at some point to overflow, crashing the server and providing serious technical issues. While it is true that MongoDB can hold a ridiculously large amount of data, the server could receive a ridiculously large amount of requests. A possible solution involves using a user-access key to restrict submissions to only those who have been permitted to submit. Keys could be deactivated upon discovery of malicious use.</li></p>
