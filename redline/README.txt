COMP20: Web Programming
Ryan Havens
Lab 6: Where's the Train? (MBTA Red Line)?
===============================

1. What has been implemented correctly?

I have correctly implemented the map but there is no data on the map because
XMLHttpRequest is unable to pull data. On my own time I will experiment with
downloading, parsing, and rendering the JSON data, but within the scope of the 
lab this is unnecessary.

2. Co-collaborators?

I have collaborated with no one else on this assignment.

3. Time spent?

The assignment took 30 minutes.

EXTRA:
Is it possible to request the real-time data from MBTA using XMLHttpRequest?
Why or why not?

It is not possible to do this because the cross-origin resource sharing policy
prohibits XMLHttpRequest from accessing other websites' data due to security
reasons.
