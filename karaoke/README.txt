=============================
Lab 5: "The six o'clock alarm would never ring"
COMP 20: Web Programming
--Ryan Havens--
=============================

1. Everything has been implemented properly.
I took extra measures to add support for scrubbing as the timeupdate event
listener didn't seem to be working when the time was "scrubbed." I added a
playing event listener which triggers whenever the video resumes playing (in
this case, after scrubbing).
To add the lyrics I injected <p>[lyrics]</p> into the div. I did the same thing
for images; they are directly inline with the text.

2. I worked with Max Ettleson (mostly to debug a boatload of syntax errors)

3. I spent about an hour on the assignment
